__**There are a few things you need to do to gain full access to the Discord:**__

     **1**) Join our group on the100.io. This is where we schedule our games. You can still do PUGs in Discord, but this is the core of our group. https://www.the100.io/g/3140

     **2**) Be sure to right click your name in Discord and select "Change Nickname." If your main game is a blizzard game use your BattlenetId. If it's a Steam game like PUBG please change your nickname to match your Steam name and format like this: "Username (Steam)." See here for more info: https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames

     **3**) Familiarize yourself with our ${bot.channels.find('name', 'rules_and_info')}.

     **4**) Once you've done everything above, post in ${bot.channels.find('name', 'welcome_new_members')} to get promoted to Grunt and have full acess to our Discord.

That's it! If you have any questions, please let a member of the leadership team know or post in ${bot.channels.find('name', 'welcome_new_members')} for help.`
